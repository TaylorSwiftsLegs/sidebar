Read and follow their rules while you're there. Otherwise I may have to break your legs and ban you from this sub as well.    
     
**Note from StarFox420**    
This subreddit is not intended to be offensive to anyone, especially the lovely Taylor Swift. If she hears of and is offended by this sub, or it makes her feel uncomfortable, I (StarFox420) will personally eradicate it. This isn't a place for creeps, this is a place for appreciation.
